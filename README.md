# Rhombus — Distributed NL-to-Regex Data Processing Platform
This is a web application that allows users to: 
- upload CSV or Excel files, 
- describe text patterns in natural language, and 
- apply transformations at scale. 

Natural language is converted to regex via an LLM, cached in Redis, and applied across millions of rows using PySpark asynchronously, without ever blocking the web request cycle.

Two flows run concurrently. 
The fast path is synchronous and takes milliseconds: 
- React posts the file and job parameters, 
- Django saves the file to the shared volume, persists a Job row, pushes a task message onto Redis, and returns a job ID immediately. 

The slow path is asynchronous: 
- a Celery worker pops the task, 
- resolves the natural-language prompt to a transformation spec (checking the Redis cache before calling the LLM), 
- applies the transformation via native PySpark functions, and 
- writes Parquet output back to the shared volume while reporting progress to Redis throughout. 

Meanwhile React polls the status endpoint every two seconds, then fetches paginated results once the job succeeds.


## Why This Architecture
### Why Celery instead of processing inline? 
A million-row Spark job takes seconds to minutes; a web request must return in milliseconds. Any heavy work inside a Django view blocks a web worker thread — under load, all threads block and the server stops responding to everyone. The web process here does nothing but coordinate: validate, persist, dispatch, respond.

### Why Redis wears three hats? 
Redis serves as the Celery message broker (db 0), the result backend for live progress state (db 1), and the LLM response cache (db 2). All three are access patterns Redis is built for: fast queue operations, high-frequency small reads for polling, and TTL-based key-value caching. PostgreSQL and Redis are not competitors here — PostgreSQL holds durable relational records (the Job row survives a restart), Redis holds fast ephemeral state (progress percentages, cached patterns). Losing Redis state is acceptable; losing job records is not.

### Why the LLM never sees the column selection. 
The LLM's only responsibility is converting a natural-language description into a pattern — it receives the prompt and nothing else. Column selection is deterministic, chosen from a dropdown validated against the file's actual schema. This decoupling keeps the regex cache effective across different jobs and columns (the same prompt yields the same cached pattern regardless of which column it targets), isolates failure domains (an LLM outage cannot break column selection), and avoids a class of silent errors where the model guesses the wrong column from ambiguous phrasing. The assessment's example embeds the column name in the prompt sentence; per the explicit requirement in section 4 ("input fields... to choose the target column(s)"), this implementation uses a dedicated selector — prompts that happen to mention a column still work, since the LLM simply ignores routing language that doesn't describe a pattern.

### Why LLM calls are O(1) per job, never O(n) per row. 
Every transformation resolves to exactly one LLM call (or zero, on a cache hit) regardless of whether the file has ten rows or ten million. The LLM interprets intent once; Spark applies the result at scale using native, vectorized functions. This is the constraint that keeps the design scale-safe — a per-row LLM classification feature, however appealing, would mean a million API calls per job and was deliberately excluded.

### Why polling instead of WebSockets. 
WebSockets would deliver progress updates instantly instead of on a 2-second cadence — but require Django Channels, an ASGI server, and stateful per-client connections that complicate horizontal scaling. For jobs measured in seconds to minutes, a 2-second staleness window is imperceptible. Polling is the simplest correct solution for this latency requirement; the added infrastructure wasn't justified.

### Why Parquet output. 
Spark writes results as compressed, columnar Parquet. For the paginated read pattern (write once, read in small pages), Parquet is a dramatically better fit than inserting a million rows into PostgreSQL per job — which would create write load and storage bloat on exactly the wrong tool. Django's results endpoint reads the Parquet directory (handling Spark's multi-part-file output transparently via pandas/PyArrow) and serves 100-row pages.


## Transformations — Strategy/Registry Pattern
Three transformation types run through the same async/Spark pipeline:

|          Type         	|               LLM output              	|         Spark function         	|
|:---------------------:	|:-------------------------------------:	|:------------------------------:	|
| Find & Replace        	| free-form regex (validated)           	| regexp_replace                 	|
| Extract to New Column 	| free-form regex (validated)           	| regexp_extract → new column    	|
| Standardize Format    	| constrained choice from an allow-list 	| upper / lower / initcap / trim 	|


Each type is a class implementing a two-method interface (generate_spec, apply), registered in a dictionary. 
The Celery task retrieves the right strategy by name and never branches on type — adding a fourth transformation means one new class and one registry line, with zero changes to the task, views, or error handling. 
This is the Open/Closed principle applied deliberately: the earlier single-type implementation would have required editing tested task code for every addition.

The two regex-based types share one LLM path and one cache namespace (identical prompts yield identical patterns regardless of what's done with the match). Standardize Format demonstrates a deliberately different LLM integration pattern: instead of generating open-ended text that must be validated for syntax and safety, the model selects from a fixed enum — including an explicit NONE escape hatch for requests that match no supported operation, which fails the job immediately with a clear message rather than force-fitting a wrong-but-valid choice.

### Regex safety
Generated patterns are validated before touching data: syntax-checked via re.compile, and screened for nested-quantifier shapes ((a+)+) associated with catastrophic backtracking. 
Validation failures raise a dedicated exception class that fails the job immediately — deterministic failures (bad pattern, missing column) skip the retry cycle entirely, while transient failures (network errors, API rate limits) retry with exponential backoff (5s → 25s → 125s).

## PySpark Partitioning & Parallelism Justification
The Spark session runs in local[*] mode, using all available CPU cores on the worker machine. 
No manual partitioning is implemented, deliberately: spark.read.csv produces a sensible default partitioning for this workload, and every transformation is a native Spark SQL function (regexp_replace, regexp_extract, initcap, etc.) — vectorized operations that Spark distributes across partitions automatically. 
The critical design constraint was avoiding Python UDFs, which would force row-by-row execution through the Python interpreter and defeat the purpose of using Spark at all.

spark.sql.shuffle.partitions is reduced from the default 200 to 4, appropriate for a single-machine deployment. 
Scaling to a genuine multi-node cluster would require changing one configuration line (master("local[*]") → a cluster manager URL) — the transformation code itself is already cluster-ready because it uses only distributed-safe native functions.

## Setup & Run Instructions
### Prerequisites
1. Docker with the Compose plugin
2. A Google Gemini API key (free tier: https://ai.google.dev)

### Local development
1. git clone https://github.com/zlib-eng/rhombusAI-assessment.git
2. cd rhombusAI-assessment

### Create your environment file
3. cp .env.example .env   # then fill in GEMINI_API_KEY and passwords

.env values required:
    POSTGRES_DB=rhombus
    POSTGRES_USER=rhombus
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<choose one>
    POSTGRES_HOST=db
    POSTGRES_PORT=5432

    REDIS_URL_BROKER=redis://redis:6379/0
    REDIS_URL_RESULTS=redis://redis:6379/1
    REDIS_URL_CACHE=redis://redis:6379/2

    SHARED_FILES_PATH=/shared/files

    GEMINI_API_KEY=<your key>

    DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=<generate: python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(50))">
    DJANGO_DEBUG=True
    DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1

    FLOWER_USER=admin
    FLOWER_PASSWORD=<choose one>

Then:
4. docker compose up --build
5. docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate
6. docker compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser

    -- App: http://localhost:5173
    -- API: http://localhost:8000/api/
    -- Admin: http://localhost:8000/admin/
    -- Flower (worker monitoring): http://localhost:5555
    
### Production deployment
The production stack (docker-compose.prod.yml) differs from development in the following:
- Gunicorn replaces the Django dev server, 
- the frontend is a pre-built static bundle (npm run build, with the API base URL baked in from frontend/.env.production), 
- source-code volume mounts are removed (code is baked into images at build time), and
- restart: unless-stopped policies keep services alive across reboots.

7. docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
8. docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec web python manage.py migrate

Deployed on an AWS EC2 instance (2 vCPU / 4GB RAM — PySpark's JVM requirements rule out sub-1GB free hosting tiers). 
Ports 8000 (API) and 5173 (frontend) are open publicly; 
5555 (Flower) is restricted to a single admin IP since it exposes internal task state.


#### Large File Test
A generated 1,000,000-row CSV (~115MB: Name, Id, Phone, Email, Notes columns with randomized values) processed end-to-end on the deployed 2-vCPU instance:

1. Wall time: 5.6 seconds from task pickup to SUCCESS — including file read, transformation, and Parquet write
2. LLM calls: zero — the prompt had been cached from a prior job, demonstrating the cache working at scale
3. Pagination: ~10,000 pages of 100 rows; page loads remain fast at arbitrary page offsets
4. The upload itself is streamed to disk in chunks (file.chunks()) — the web process never holds the full file in memory

### Observability
Flower provides real-time worker monitoring at port 5555 (basic-auth protected): live task state, per-task runtimes and arguments, success/failure/retry counts, and task history. Its value is operational — answering "what is the system doing right now, and what did it do when I wasn't watching" without shelling into servers to grep Celery logs. During development, silent retry cycles (exponential backoff on a deterministic failure) initially presented as a "frozen" progress bar; Flower makes exactly that state visible at a glance.


## Known Trade-offs & Limitations
#### Page refresh loses frontend job state. 
The job continues processing server-side, but the UI has no jobs-list view to re-attach to it. A localStorage-persisted job ID or a job history endpoint would resolve this.

#### Ambiguous prompts can yield valid-but-mismatched patterns. 
Observed concretely in testing: "extract the area code" against Australian two-digit area codes produced a US-style three-digit pattern — syntactically valid, semantically wrong for the data, resulting in a correct-but-empty extraction. The system behaves properly (zero matches, no failure), but the user experience would benefit from a pre-execution match-count preview so interpretation mismatches surface before full processing. This is the most instructive limitation of NL-driven transformation generally: natural language underspecs, and the pipeline cannot know the user's data format unless told.

#### Spark's CSV reader strips leading/trailing whitespace at ingestion 
by default, making the TRIM operation a no-op for CSV-sourced data (it remains useful for Excel sources). Pinning ignoreLeadingWhiteSpace/ignoreTrailingWhiteSpace explicitly would preserve raw whitespace if that mattered for a use case.

#### Files with partially blank headers 
have those columns excluded from selection (pandas names them Unnamed: N; Spark names the same columns _c N — a cross-library inconsistency that previously caused a confusing runtime failure, now caught at upload with a user-facing warning). Spark's fallback names may still appear in results if such columns exist in the source.

#### Single worker with concurrency 2. 
Each concurrent Spark task spawns a JVM; concurrency is capped to protect the 4GB instance. Horizontal scaling would add worker containers (the architecture already supports it — workers coordinate only through Redis).

#### transformation_type dispatch uses a registry dict. 
At the current three types this is the right size; if the catalogue grew substantially, per-type serializer validation and UI configuration would also want to become part of each strategy class rather than living in the view.
